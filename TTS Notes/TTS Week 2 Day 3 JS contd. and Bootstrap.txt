           comparing variable to desired breakpoint
loop will stop when breakpoint is met	 

let turkeyQuantity;
turkeyQuantity = 5;
console.log("Thank you for your order of", turkeyQuantity, "turkeys");

for (let i = 1; i <= turkeyQuantity; i = i + 1) {
	console.log("Gobble!");
}
console.log("Have a happy Thanksgiving!");

to have "Gobble!"s on one line
add let gobbleString = ""; variable
gobbleString = gobbleString + "Gobble! ";
console.log(gobbleString);
i = i+1 is the same as i++
*Beware of infinite loops!*
Loop will not execute if statement is false from the beginning

While loop
"For" loop we choose starting point, how to iterate and where the breakpoint is. 'While' loop simply looks for a conditional to be true
turkeyQuantity = 5;
	let i=1;
	while (i <= turkeyQuantity){
		console.log("Gobble!");
			i=i+1;
	}
	console.log("Have a happy Thanksgiving")
