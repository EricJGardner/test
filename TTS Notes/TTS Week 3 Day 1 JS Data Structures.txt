TTS Week 3 Day 1 11/30/20 Javascript Data Structures
Data Types:
Strings
Numbers
Booleans-can only be true or false
Arrays-can take multiple values, are ordered lists with methods to traverse and edit its contents.The ordered list has a zero based index, contents can be dynamic in length and types
 syntax: let fruits ={"Apple", "banana", "mango"];
 let scores = [1,3,2,9];
spaces and lines don't matter
let fruits = ["apple",   //index is 0
		"banana",  //index is 1
		"mango"];  //index is 2
    length of ^ array is 3
to print apple console.log(fruits[0]);
for (let i = 0; i <=2; i++) {
console.log(fruits[i]);
}
^prints each fruit in order (traverses the array)
to change "mango" to "papaya"
fruits[2] = "papaya";
//pluralizing all the fruits in array
for (let i = 0; i <= 2; i++); {
 tempfruit = fruits[i];
tempfruit = tempfruit + "s";
fruits[i] = tempfruit;
console.log (fruits[i];
}
for (let i = 0; i <=2; i++); {
console.log (fruits[i]0);
or, even better
for (let i=0; i<=2; i++) {
fruits[i] = fruits[i] + "s";
console.log (fruits[i]);
}

Arrays have a 'length' property
let sizeOfArray = fruits.length;
console.log("the length of the array is ", sizeOFArray);
arrays have bult-in properties
use "dot" notation to access those properties
for (let i = 0; i <= fruits.length -1; i++);
or (let i = 0; i < fruits.length; i++);
to add another element to array
 fruits[3] = "Orange";
Push and Pop functions- always takes or adds to last element in array, the one with the highest index
let teachers = ["Shane", "Zack"];
teachers.push("Assaf"); //["Shane", "Zack", "Assaf"]
let teacher1 = teachers.pop();  //teacher 1 == "Assaf", teachers == ["Shane", "Zack"]
Shift and Unshift (from the front of the array)
let teachers = ["Assaf", "Shane"];
teachers.unshift("Zack"); //["Zack", "Assaf", "Shane"]
let teacher = teachers.shift(): //teacher = "Zack", teachers = ["Assaf", "Shane"]
slice() needs to accept 2 arguments, start and end, and returns a new array. This new array will hold the elemnts from the given start index up to the one right before the specified index number
splice() is a mustating function that takes at least 2 arguments. It tells us where to start, how many items to remove from the starting point, and then what to replace it with
let a = [1,2,3,4];
a.slice(0,2); //[1,2]
"abcd".slice(1,3) //"bc"
a.splice(1,2,'a','b'); //a is [1,'a','b',4]

.toString() converts arrays to strings
teachers=["Assaf", "Shane"];
teachers.toString(); "Assaf, Shane"
teachers.join('&'); "Assaf&Shane"

Objects-a collection of data, but is unordered and has mor functionality.
An object is a set of keys and values, like a dictionary.
Keys are like variables, must start with a lowercase letter
let course= {  //declares an object
	name: "Javascript Applications",
	awesome: true
}
Object properties can be accessed with either dot notation course.name
or bracket notation course["name]
properties of objects can be updated after being created course.name = "Super duper class";
Mutating: you can also assign totally new keys or delete existing ones
course.fun = true; //add a property
delete course.name; //remove a property
