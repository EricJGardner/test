Tables
<table> for tabular data, similar to a spreadsheet
Nested tags build the anatomy of the table
 <tr>- represents start of a new row
 <td>- represents start of a new columnn within a row
 <th>- represents special header column. Should only be used in the first row in place of the        standard <td>. Headers will appear in bold.

Relative vs absolute paths- always use relative so if the source folder moves, the path name will still work

<div> - creates a container for lines of code so that you can apply styling to only that section of code
coding principle- DRY- "Don't Repeat Yourself" or KISS "Keep It Simple Stupid"
Instead of style="color:red;" for each line of text, do 
<div style="color:red;"> and it will apply to everything in between <div> and </div>
