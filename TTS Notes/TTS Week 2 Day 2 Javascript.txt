JavaScript runs on browsers or on a node

3 keywords used to declare variables- var, let, const
 they are used to declare the scope and mutability
'let' is the new 'var'
you don't have to actually assign a variable when you create it (declare). A variable with no value is called unassigned

let x=5;
console.log() //syntax rule
 variables can be reassigned unless it is declared const (constant)
const variables cannot be changed

let x; //variable declaration
x=5;  //variable assignment
name variables in camelcase- yourVariable

you can only declare a variable once, but it can be reassigned i.e,
you can only write let x= once, but yu can write x= more than once

If statements- based on booleans (T or F)
if(x) {
	console.log(true);
}
else {}
Flow Control- Comparison Operators
< less than
> greater than
<= less than or equal to
>= greater than or equal to
== loose equality (compares values)
=== strict equality (compares value and type)
!= values do not equal
!== same type, but different value

to limit number to hundredths place my_number.toFixed(2)
