* CSS always goes in head of code*
can do font-size, font-family, color
-not all browsers will have same fonts, so use 3 values i.e., "Times New Roman", Times, serif
text-align
if you want formatting to apply to more than one selector, add a comma- h3, h6

ID selector matches an element based on the value of the element's id attribute
In order for the element to be selected, its attribute must match exactly the value given the selector
#id_value{property:value}
id_value is a name you create
#best {
	color:red;
	}
<h3 id="best">
The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select only one unique element

Class selectors
 Selects HTML elements within a specific class attribute.
 To select elements within a specific class, use a period (.), followed by class name
.name{property:value}
 can be used in more than one place in a page
<h3 class="name">
Cascading styles- goes from general to specific
ID override class override tags. Only way to override an ID is with another ID

Margin- set in page size
Border-goes in from page size
Padding- affects inside the border

BEST PRACTICES-
Instead of styling with the header, create a style sheet that you can use over and over for any page

Within the head of your HTML, write <link> to connect to CSS style sheet. 
common attributes for a link tag-
 type- comon use is to define the type of style sheet linked. most common is txt/css, which indicates Cascading Style Sheet Format
 rel- This lets the browser know what type of file to link. In this case a stylesheet
 href- specifies the URL of the linked resource

Pseudo Class Selectors- a keyword that reps what state something may be in. it is added to a selsector by a colon (:). It allows you to style selected elements only when they are in a certain state.
 LINKS-4 states of a link- unvisited, visited, hover(mouseover), and active
