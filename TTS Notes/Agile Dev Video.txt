  Iron Triangle of Project Management
    Waterfall- Plan Driven   Agile- Value and Vision Driven
Agile is a team based alternative to some of the traditional projectmgmt techniques. Prefer to start executing earlier, delivering frequently, repeatedly evaluate objectives, and repeatedly confirm satisfaction.

Principles- 
1.Individuals and Interactions over processes and tools
2.working software over comprehensive documentation
3.customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4.responding to change over following a plan

SCRUM 
-Product Backlog- collection of user stories (wishlist of desired features)
 Scrum master- like a project manager
Release Planning- identify user stories to go into product backlog, priorites them and estimate how long each one will take
Sprints- short duration milestones (couple of days to a month) breaks up product backlog
BURNDOWN CHART (#1 feature of Scrum)- provides a day by day measure of the amount of work that remains in a given sprint or release
burndown velocity- slope of the burndown graph, from start to zero 
DAILY SCRUM- fast paced standup meetings to check on progress and problems
Sprint Retrospective- team reflects on what went right and what needs improvement
OnTime- Scrum management software
Product Owner *)Maximizes the value of the product(Eye on Market, Scope vs Schedule)
		Managing the product backlog (Creation, Management, Prioritization)
		Represent the desire of stakeholders
Scrum Master  *) a "servant leader"-facilitates development, removes impediments for dev team, bring changes that increase productivity for team, etc

Scrum Process Cycle
	Scrum Sprint- Vision>Product Backlog>Sprint Backlog [daily scrum]>Product Increment
					         ^             v
					(Sprint Planning<----Sprint Review Retrospective)
Product Backlog- (property of product owner) High level features, estimates & priorities, no tasks, highly changeable
	Grooming session- every 2 weeks, owner meets with SM to reevaluate
Epics- large user stories
Sprint backlog- Decomposed tasks nec to build features, etc, for next sprint
Story Points- estimate how long it will take to complete a user story
Burndown Chart- shows progress in completing the sprint

AGILE
Root Cause Analysis-identifying cause of problems, identifying processes to address them
Ishikawa- Fishbone Diagram
PDCA- Plan, Do, Check, Act
Story Board (KANBAN)KANBAN uses a chart with categories to identify what needs to be done, in progress, next, blocked, etc (sushi menu)
  WIP (Work in Progress)limits- limits what can be in progress category in chart

Grooming Sessions
 MoSCoW- Must, Should, Could, Would (not)
Sprint Planning-Poker, T Shirt sizes, Fist of Five Technique, Delphi method-ways of identifying difficulty/time req for tasks and assigning them to proper team members
Sprint retrospective-what went well, could be improved, to stop doing, to keep doing, & to start doing (start, stop, keep, more, or less)
Reporting- Status, baselines, Milestones, Burndown, Risks & Issues, Defects & Blockers, New & Outstanding items
Best Practice- avoid common traps of sprint planning, stand up meetings, retrospective

Agile Transformation- Scrum Master needs to be impartial, avoiding common problems that prevent an efficient, productive standup (same people always talking, no one talking, too long meeting, etc.)

Agile Process Implementation- (Phase 1)Form Agile Committee, A3 Root Cause Analysis, Agile Training, Create Product Backlog, Sprint Zero Planning
		(Phase 2) Create Scrumboard, Daily Standup Meetings, Sprint Review, Retrospective, Reporting
		(Phase 3) Agile Coaches, Formal Training, New Hires (Scrum Committee>{Scrum of Scrums, Improved Reporting, Quarterly/A3 RCA})
